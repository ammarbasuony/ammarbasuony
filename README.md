🚀 I am a Senior Software Engineer with +10 years of experience specializing in Software Development.

👨‍💻 Experienced with all stages of the development cycle for dynamic Software-Based projects.

🔍 Well-versed in numerous programming languages including Advanced (HTML, CSS), JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and MongoDB. And frameworks including React, React Native, Vue, Tailwind, and Node.js.

🏗️ Also, have a Strong background in project management methodologies using Agile (Scrum and Kanban) and Waterfall.

Consistently, I've always been passionate about 🎨 color, 🔴🟢 shapes, 🔢 logic, and ➕➖ mathematics, and at the same time, I was fond of 💻 writing code. Finally, I discovered the way I can combine them. In my view, programming is a way to survive. I started the journey from the earliest age (15 years old), beginning from the basics and diving into the advanced more profound, and deeper, then I made more projects for different clients from different 🌎 countries.
